# Named Data Networking simulation. 
#### The simulation is built based on the NDN architecture and process. 
#### There are four major classes based on the structure of NDN: Packet, ContentStore, PendingInterestTable and Vertex. 

#### For statistical indicators, the simulation counts the total packet loss, number of steps, average load of the whole network, average load of each vertex.
